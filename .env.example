# Backend: use ONE of the two options below (or leave both empty for mock data).

# --- Option A: Neon + Netlify (recommended – no rate limit) ---
# Your Netlify site URL + /api (no trailing slash). Example:
VITE_API_URL=https://craftric-crm.netlify.app/api
# For local dev with Netlify: VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8888/api
# VITE_API_URL=

# For Netlify deploy you MUST set BOTH in Netlify (Site → Environment variables):
#   - DATABASE_URL = your Neon connection string (used by the serverless API)
#   - VITE_API_URL = https://YOUR-SITE.netlify.app/api (used by the frontend at build time)
# Do NOT set VITE_XANO_BASE_URL when using Neon, or the app may use mock data for CRUD.

# --- Option B: Xano (10 requests / 20 sec on free plan) ---
# VITE_XANO_BASE_URL=https://xxx.xano.io/api:your_api_group_id
# VITE_XANO_API_KEY=

# Leave both empty to use in-app mock data.

# --- Password reset email (Neon API only; set in Netlify Environment variables) ---
# Resend (https://resend.com): create an API key and add it in Netlify:
#   RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxx
# Optional: sender address (default: Craftric CRM <onboarding@resend.dev>)
#   RESEND_FROM=Craftric CRM <noreply@yourdomain.com>
# The reset link base URL is taken from Netlify's URL. For custom domain, URL is set automatically.
# Optional override: SITE_URL=https://your-app.netlify.app
